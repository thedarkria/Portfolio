            <p>As with any handyman, I began exploring repair with 
                cars. Learning the electronic system was especially helpful.

            <p>I've had a few jobs, but I worked at an auto parts store
                for the longest. I've learned the most about customer service
                and working as a team.

            <p>Most of my formal education came from the State
                College of Florida, where i took almost 
                exclusively computer science courses.

                and motivation to change industries and put my education
                to good use and build a career for myself.
