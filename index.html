            <p>As with many handymen, I began exploring repair with 
                cars. Learning the electronic system was especially helpful.

            <p>I've had a few minor jobs, but I worked at an auto parts store
                for the longest. The most important skills I received were customer service
                communications and how to diagnose machines
